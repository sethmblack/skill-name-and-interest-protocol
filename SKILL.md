## Core Principles (Carnegie Part 2: Six Ways to Make People Like You)

### The Fundamental Truth

> "You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."

People don't want to hear about you. They want to talk about themselves. Give them that gift, and they will like you.

### The Six Ways

1. **Become genuinely interested in other people**
   - Not fake interest—genuine curiosity about their work, challenges, and story
   - Ask questions you actually want to know the answers to

2. **Smile**
   - Your expression speaks before your words
   - Even on video calls, a genuine smile changes the tone

3. **Remember that a person's name is the sweetest sound**
   - Use their name in conversation (not mechanically, but naturally)
   - Forgetting a name is an insult; remembering it is a compliment

4. **Be a good listener—encourage others to talk about themselves**
   - Listen to understand, not to respond
   - Ask follow-up questions that show you heard

5. **Talk in terms of the other person's interests**
   - Research what matters to them before meeting
   - Frame your contributions in their context

6. **Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely**
   - Notice and acknowledge their expertise
   - Ask for their opinion; value their input

## Workflow
### Step 1: Before the Meeting: Preparation

#### Name Memorization

If you have names in advance:
- Look up their LinkedIn/social profiles (face + name)
- Note pronunciation if unusual
- Find one memorable detail to associate with each name

#### Interest Research

Learn what you can about each person:
- Their role and what they're responsible for
- Recent projects or announcements
- Shared connections or experiences
- Their professional interests or expertise areas

#### Genuine Questions Prepared

Draft questions you're actually curious about:
- "I saw you worked on [X]—how did you approach the [specific challenge]?"
- "What's been the most interesting problem your team has tackled recently?"
- "How did you get into this field?"

### Step 2: During the Meeting: Engagement

#### Opening

- Use names: "Sarah, great to meet you. I've heard great things about the platform team."
- Express genuine interest: "I'm really curious to hear about the challenges you're facing with scale."

#### Conversation Flow

**The 70/30 Rule:** They talk 70% of the time, you talk 30%.

**Listen actively:**
- Maintain eye contact (even on video)
- Nod and give verbal acknowledgments
- Take brief notes if appropriate
- Don't interrupt

**Ask follow-up questions:**
- "How did that turn out?"
- "What was the hardest part?"
- "What would you do differently?"

**Use names naturally:**
- "That's interesting, David—I hadn't thought about it that way."
- Not: "David, I understand, David, what you're saying, David."

#### Making Them Feel Important

- Ask for their opinion: "What do you think we should prioritize?"
- Acknowledge expertise: "You've been dealing with this longer than anyone—what patterns have you seen?"
- Credit their ideas: "I love how you framed that."

### Step 3: After the Meeting: Follow-Up

#### Within 24 Hours

- Send a brief note referencing something specific they said
- "Thanks for the conversation today—your point about [X] really stuck with me."

#### Ongoing

- Remember what they told you for next time
- Follow up on things they mentioned: "How did that migration go?"
- Connect them with relevant information or people

## Name Memory Techniques

### Association Method
Link the name to something memorable:
- "Sarah with the system architecture"
- "David who did the database migration"

### Repetition Method
Use the name 3 times in the first few minutes:
- When introduced: "Nice to meet you, Michael."
- During conversation: "Michael, that's a great point."
- At close: "Michael, thanks for your time today."

### Write It Down
If you can, note names during introductions—people understand and appreciate the effort.

## Constraints

- Never fake interest—if you're not curious, find something you genuinely want to know
- Never use names mechanically—natural usage only
- Never dominate the conversation—monitor your talk ratio
- Never forget to follow up—rapport requires maintenance
- Never treat this as manipulation—genuine interest is the foundation

- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

### Participant Profile
| Name | Role | What I Know | Genuine Question |
|------|------|-------------|------------------|
| Marcus | Team lead | 8 years tenure, deep institutional knowledge | "What's changed most about the platform since you started?" |
| Chen | Senior engineer | ML background—unusual for platform | "How does your ML experience inform how you think about platform problems?" |
| Priya | Infrastructure | New-ish, 6 months | "What surprised you most about joining this team?" |
| James | DevOps | Known for incident response | "I've heard you're the person to have on call during an incident—what's your secret?" |
| Sofia | Database focus | New graduate, early career | "What drew you to database work? What are you excited to learn?" |

### Name Memorization Notes
- Marcus: "M" for Mentor—the team lead
- Chen: Machine Learning Chen (unique background)
- Priya: Platform-Priya (infrastructure focus)
- James: James handles Jams (incidents)
- Sofia: Sofia writes SQL (database)

### Opening Approach
"Thanks for making time to meet with me—I've been really looking forward to learning about how your team thinks about the platform. I know integration projects can be tricky, so I want to make sure I understand your world before we dive into requirements."

### Conversation Strategy
**My genuine interests about them:**
- How do they think about reliability vs. feature velocity?
- What's their biggest pain point right now?
- How do they prefer to collaborate with other teams?

**Ways to make them feel important:**
- Ask Marcus for historical context before forming opinions
- Acknowledge Chen's unique ML perspective
- Ask James what he wishes other teams knew about incident response
- Give Sofia opportunities to contribute despite being junior

### 70/30 Check
**Questions to keep them talking:**
- "Tell me more about how that works..."
- "What was the reasoning behind that decision?"
- "What would make this integration easier from your perspective?"
- "What's the one thing I should know about working with this platform?"

### Follow-Up Plan
**Within 24 hours:**
"Thanks for the great conversation today. Marcus, your point about the migration three years ago really helped me understand the current architecture. Chen, I'd love to hear more about that ML observability idea you mentioned—maybe we can grab coffee next week?"

**Ongoing:**
- Remember Sofia is working on the query optimizer—ask about progress next time
- James mentioned they're short-staffed for on-call—be mindful of asks
- Marcus values documentation—make sure to document our integration points
